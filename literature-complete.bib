  abstract = {A procedure for the quantitative analysis of transient surface catalytic
	reactions in millisecond time resolution has been studied constructing
	a specially designed apparatus employing (1) pulsed-gas valves for
	the injection of reactant molecules onto catalysts and (2) a time-of-flight
	mass spectrometer (TOF-MS) to detect every reaction product simultaneously.
	For a better understanding of the catalytic activity and selectivity
	for products quantitatively, a procedure for measuring an amount
	of reactant molecules injected onto catalyst surface and calibrating
	the intensity of mass signal were proposed and implemented. We tested
	the applicability of this procedure for the quantitative analysis
	of products of NO+H(2) reaction on Pt-Al(2)O(3) catalysts (a planar
	catalyst: Pt-Al(2)O(3)/Si substrates inserted into a micro-tube-reactor
	with SiC balls). Although the surface area of the planar catalyst
	was very small, the mass signal intensities of the reaction products
	were found to be sufficient for the above procedure. We measured
	the fragmentation patterns and the inherent sensitivity factors in
	the TOF-MS using the mixture of the internal standard gas Ar and
	the N-containing gases. The relative sensitivity factors for NH(3),
	N(2), NO, and N(2)O and the relative intensities of fragment peaks
	to the molecular ion peak of H(2)O and N(2)O were estimated. The
	procedure constructed here has enabled us to analyze the transient
	consecutive secondary catalytic reactions as well as primary reactions
	based on the formation rate of product molecules per millisecond
	instead of the mass signal intensities of the reaction products.
