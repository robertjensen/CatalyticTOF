	have been performed on MoO3-Pr6O11 mixtures before and after their
	use in the selective oxidation of isobutene to methacrolein at 673
	K. The three pure molybdate phases (Pr2MoO6, Pr2Mo3O12, Pr6MoO12)
	obtained independently by the citrate route have also been examined
	to determine their respective SIMS fragmentation patterns. Although
	the Pr2MoO6 and Pr2Mo3O12 phases were found to give the same molecular
	fragments, these phases could be distinguished by the relative intensity
	ratios of some particular species. Identification of Pr6MoO12 was
	easier owing to the presence of characteristic high-mass mixed Pr-Mo
	fragments. A linear relationship was observed when plotting the experimental
	intensity ratios of several molecular fragments against the Pr/Mo
	bulk composition. The same behaviour was also noticed for a series
	of Pr6O11-MoO3 mixtures. Moreover, the examination of the 3-D crystal
	structure of the pure molybdate phases indicates that the fragmentation
	patterns of these phases were directly related to their structure.
	As far as the used catalysts were concerned, the SIMS results showed
	that: (i) the experimental intensity ratios of given fragments were
	much smaller in the used catalysts than in the fresh ones; (ii) fragments
	characteristic of the Pr6MoO12 phase were absent; and (iii) differences
	in the relative SIMS intensities of certain fragments showed the
	dominant presence of the Pr2Mo3O12 phase.},

  abstract = {A novel microfabricated chemical reactor for highly sensitive measurements
	of catalytic activity and surface kinetics is presented. The reactor
	is fabricated in a silicon chip and is intended for gas-phase reactions
	at pressures ranging from 0.1 to 5.0 bar. A high sensitivity is obtained
	by directing the entire gas flow through the catalyst bed to a mass
	spectrometer, thus ensuring that nearly all reaction products are
	present in the analyzed gas flow. Although the device can be employed
	for testing a wide range of catalysts, the primary aim of the design
	is to allow characterization of model catalysts which can only be
	obtained in small quantities. Such measurements are of significant
	fundamental interest but are challenging because of the low surface
	areas involved. The relationship between the reaction zone gas flow
	and the pressure in the reaction zone is investigated experimentally.
	A corresponding theoretical model is presented, and the gas flow
	through an on-chip flow-limiting capillary is predicted to be in
	the intermediate regime. The experimental data for the gas flow are
	found to be in good agreement with the theoretical model. At typical
	experimental conditions, the total gas flow through the reaction
	zone is around 3 x 10(14) molecules s(-1), corresponding to a gas
	residence time in the reaction zone of about 11 s. To demonstrate
	the operation of the microreactor, CO oxidation on low-area platinum
	thin film circles is employed as a test reaction. Using temperature
	ramping, it is found that platinum catalysts with areas as small
	as 15 mu m(2) are conveniently characterized with the device. (C)

	Density functional theory (DFT) calculations explored the reaction

	experimentally, that ammonia is activated by adsorbed oxygen, by
	O or by OH. XPS up to 1 mbar showed the existence of NH ( = 0,1,2,3)
	intermediates on Pt(533). Based on a mechanism of ammonia activation
	the interaction with O/OH a detailed and a simplified mathematical
	model were formulated which reproduced the experimental data semiquantitatively.
	From transient experiments in vacuum performed in a transient analysis
	of products (TAP) reactor it was concluded that NO is formed by recombination
	of two NO species and by a reaction between NO and NH ( = 0,1,2)
	fragments. Reaction-induced morphological changes were studied with

	reactivity and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS)
	analysis of surfaces prepared or modified through soft and reactive
	landing of mass-selected polyatomic cations and anions. The apparatus
	employs an electrospray ion source coupled to a high transmission
	electrodynamic ion funnel, two focusing collision quadrupoles, a
	large 19 mm diameter quadrupole mass filter, and a quadrupole bender
	that deflects the ion beam, thereby preventing neutral contaminants
	from impinging on the deposition surface. The ion soft landing apparatus
	is coupled to a commercial TOF-SIMS instrument permitting the introduction
	of surfaces into vacuum and SIMS analysis before and after ion deposition
	without breaking vacuum. To facilitate a comparison of the current

	dications of the cyclic peptide Gramicidin S (GS) and the photoactive
	organonometallic complex ruthenium tris-bipyridine (Ru-(bpy)(3))
	were soft-landed onto fluorinated self-assembled monolayer (FSAM)

	in general, characterized by greater sensitivity, larger dynamic
	range, less fragmentation, and fewer in-plume reactions than the
	corresponding FTICR-SIMS spectra. The charge reduction kinetics of
	both the doubly and singly protonated GS cations on the FSAM surface
	were also examined as was the influence of the primary gallium ion

  abstract = {A procedure for the quantitative analysis of transient surface catalytic
	reactions in millisecond time resolution has been studied constructing
	a specially designed apparatus employing (1) pulsed-gas valves for
	the injection of reactant molecules onto catalysts and (2) a time-of-flight
	mass spectrometer (TOF-MS) to detect every reaction product simultaneously.
	For a better understanding of the catalytic activity and selectivity
	for products quantitatively, a procedure for measuring an amount
	of reactant molecules injected onto catalyst surface and calibrating
	the intensity of mass signal were proposed and implemented. We tested
	the applicability of this procedure for the quantitative analysis
	of products of NO+H(2) reaction on Pt-Al(2)O(3) catalysts (a planar
	catalyst: Pt-Al(2)O(3)/Si substrates inserted into a micro-tube-reactor
	with SiC balls). Although the surface area of the planar catalyst
	was very small, the mass signal intensities of the reaction products
	were found to be sufficient for the above procedure. We measured
	the fragmentation patterns and the inherent sensitivity factors in
	the TOF-MS using the mixture of the internal standard gas Ar and
	the N-containing gases. The relative sensitivity factors for NH(3),
	N(2), NO, and N(2)O and the relative intensities of fragment peaks
	to the molecular ion peak of H(2)O and N(2)O were estimated. The
	procedure constructed here has enabled us to analyze the transient
	consecutive secondary catalytic reactions as well as primary reactions
	based on the formation rate of product molecules per millisecond
	instead of the mass signal intensities of the reaction products.

	and good time response in product detection offered by mu-reactors.
	We demonstrate this by carrying out CO oxidation and methanol oxidation

  abstract = {Ammonia oxidation over different Pt single crystal orientations and
	a Pt foil has been studied in the 10â5 to 10â2 mbar range with
	rate measurements and LEED. The reaction exhibits only a moderate
	structure sensitivity with the activity varying in the sequence Pt
	foil:Pt(533):Pt(865):Pt(443):Pt(100)&#xa0;=&#xa0;6:4:4:2:1. The activity
	is apparently mainly determined by the oxygen sticking coefficient
	which reaches 0.14 on the Pt foil. Broad hystereses in the reaction
	rates upon cyclic variation of the temperature are associated with
	reversible structural changes. The extent of reaction-induced structural
	changes depends strongly on the orientation, the total pressure and
	also on the ratio of the reactants NH3/O2. On Pt(533) and Pt(443)
	the extent of restructuring and the hysteretic behavior was found
	to depend in a non-monotonic way on the total pressure. Exposure
	to reaction conditions at 10â3 mbar creates a disordered surface
	as seen in LEED with no LEED spots visible; but after exposure to
	reaction conditions at 10â2 mbar the integral order beams in LEED
	are again visible.},
