  abstract = {A novel microfabricated chemical reactor for highly sensitive measurements
	of catalytic activity and surface kinetics is presented. The reactor
	is fabricated in a silicon chip and is intended for gas-phase reactions
	at pressures ranging from 0.1 to 5.0 bar. A high sensitivity is obtained
	by directing the entire gas flow through the catalyst bed to a mass
	spectrometer, thus ensuring that nearly all reaction products are
	present in the analyzed gas flow. Although the device can be employed
	for testing a wide range of catalysts, the primary aim of the design
	is to allow characterization of model catalysts which can only be
	obtained in small quantities. Such measurements are of significant
	fundamental interest but are challenging because of the low surface
	areas involved. The relationship between the reaction zone gas flow
	and the pressure in the reaction zone is investigated experimentally.
	A corresponding theoretical model is presented, and the gas flow
	through an on-chip flow-limiting capillary is predicted to be in
	the intermediate regime. The experimental data for the gas flow are
	found to be in good agreement with the theoretical model. At typical
	experimental conditions, the total gas flow through the reaction
	zone is around 3 x 10(14) molecules s(-1), corresponding to a gas
	residence time in the reaction zone of about 11 s. To demonstrate
	the operation of the microreactor, CO oxidation on low-area platinum
	thin film circles is employed as a test reaction. Using temperature
	ramping, it is found that platinum catalysts with areas as small
	as 15 mu m(2) are conveniently characterized with the device. (C)

  abstract = {Catalytic ammonia oxidation over platinum has been studied experimentally
	from UHV up to atmospheric pressure with polycrystalline Pt and with
	the Pt single crystal orientations (533), (443), (865), and (100).
	Density functional theory (DFT) calculations explored the reaction
	pathways on Pt(111) and Pt(211). It was shown, both in theory and
	experimentally, that ammonia is activated by adsorbed oxygen, by
	O or by OH. XPS up to 1 mbar showed the existence of NH ( = 0,1,2,3)
	intermediates on Pt(533). Based on a mechanism of ammonia activation
	the interaction with O/OH a detailed and a simplified mathematical
	model were formulated which reproduced the experimental data semiquantitatively.
	From transient experiments in vacuum performed in a transient analysis
	of products (TAP) reactor it was concluded that NO is formed by recombination
	of two NO species and by a reaction between NO and NH ( = 0,1,2)
	fragments. Reaction-induced morphological changes were studied with
	polycrystalline Pt in the mbar range and with stepped Pt single crystals
	as model systems in the range 10-10 mbar.},

  abstract = {Ammonia oxidation over different Pt single crystal orientations and
	a Pt foil has been studied in the 10â5 to 10â2 mbar range with
	rate measurements and LEED. The reaction exhibits only a moderate
	structure sensitivity with the activity varying in the sequence Pt
	foil:Pt(533):Pt(865):Pt(443):Pt(100)&#xa0;=&#xa0;6:4:4:2:1. The activity
	is apparently mainly determined by the oxygen sticking coefficient
	which reaches 0.14 on the Pt foil. Broad hystereses in the reaction
	rates upon cyclic variation of the temperature are associated with
	reversible structural changes. The extent of reaction-induced structural
	changes depends strongly on the orientation, the total pressure and
	also on the ratio of the reactants NH3/O2. On Pt(533) and Pt(443)
	the extent of restructuring and the hysteretic behavior was found
	to depend in a non-monotonic way on the total pressure. Exposure
	to reaction conditions at 10â3 mbar creates a disordered surface
	as seen in LEED with no LEED spots visible; but after exposure to
	reaction conditions at 10â2 mbar the integral order beams in LEED
	are again visible.},
